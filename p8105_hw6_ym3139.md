# Problem 0

In this problem, I created a public GitHub repository and associated R
Project for Homework 6. Within the project directory, I created a single
R Markdown file named `p8105_hw6_ym3139.Rmd` that renders to
`github_document`, and a `data/` subdirectory that stores all local data
files.

All my solutions for Problems 1 and 2 are contained in this R Markdown
file. I used git for version control, and my commit history reflects the
process of developing these solutions.
