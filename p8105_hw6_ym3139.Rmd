# Problem 0

In this problem, I created a public GitHub repository and associated R Project for Homework 6. 
Within the project directory, I created a single R Markdown file named `p8105_hw6_ym3139.Rmd` 
that renders to `github_document`, and a `data/` subdirectory that stores all local data files.

All my solutions for Problems 1 and 2 are contained in this R Markdown file. I used git for version control, and my commit history reflects the process of developing these solutions.
